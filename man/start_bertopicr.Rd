\title{Start the bertopicR Python environment}
\usage{
start_bertopicr(
  envname = "bertopic_r_env_spacy",
  initialize_spacy = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{envname}{Character string giving the name of the virtual
environment that should be used for \code{bertopicR}. This environment
is expected to contain a working Python installation, \code{spaCy}, and
any other required Python packages. Default is
\code{"bertopic_r_env_spacy"}.}

\item{initialize_spacy}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), attempt to
initialize spaCy via \pkg{spacyr} using the specified Python
environment. If \code{FALSE}, the function only configures
\pkg{reticulate} (by setting \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON}) and does not
call \code{spacyr::spacy_initialize()}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), print informative
messages about which Python binary is used, whether spaCy was
initialized, and what to do if Python is already initialized.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the function successfully sets
\code{RETICULATE_PYTHON} (and optionally initializes spaCy), or
\code{FALSE} if Python was already initialized and no changes were
made.
}
\description{
This helper function configures \pkg{reticulate} to use a dedicated
Python virtual environment (created e.g. by \code{setup_bertopic_env()})
and optionally initializes spaCy via \pkg{spacyr}. It is intended as a
one-stop call at the beginning of an R session before using functions
that depend on Python (e.g. BERTopic-style topic modelling).
}
\details{
The function is conservative: if Python has already been initialized in
the current R session, it will \emph{not} attempt to switch environments
(because \pkg{reticulate} does not support changing Python after
initialization). In that case it returns \code{FALSE} (invisibly) and,
if \code{verbose = TRUE}, prints a message indicating which Python is
currently in use.

Internally, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Checks whether \pkg{reticulate} is available.
\item If Python is already initialized (\code{reticulate::py_available(initialize = FALSE)}),
it returns without making changes and advises the user to restart R
if they want to switch environments.
\item Uses \code{reticulate::virtualenv_python(envname)} to locate the
Python executable inside the chosen virtual environment.
\item Sets the \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON} environment variable to that
path so that subsequent \pkg{reticulate} calls use this Python.
\item Optionally calls \code{spacyr::spacy_initialize()} to initialize
spaCy in that environment (if \pkg{spacyr} is installed and
\code{initialize_spacy = TRUE}).
}

The virtual environment referenced by \code{envname} must already exist
and contain the necessary Python packages. You can create and populate
such an environment with a companion function like
\code{setup_bertopic_env()}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# 1. (Optional) Create and configure the environment first
# setup_bertopic_env(envname = "bertopic_r_env_spacy")

# 2. Start bertopicR environment and initialize spaCy
start_bertopicr(envname = "bertopic_r_env_spacy",
                initialize_spacy = TRUE,
                verbose = TRUE)

# 3. If you only want to configure reticulate without spaCy:
start_bertopicr(envname = "bertopic_r_env_spacy",
                initialize_spacy = FALSE)
}
